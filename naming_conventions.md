# Github Repository Naming Conventions
Listed here for further advice if not covered above.
1. **Be Descriptive:** Choose a name that clearly and concisely describes the purpose or content of your repository. Avoid overly cryptic or vague names that may confuse users.
1. **Use Lowercase Letters:** Repository names are case-insensitive, but it's a common convention to use lowercase letters for consistency. This makes it easier for users to type and remember.
1. **Use Hyphens or Underscores:** Use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate words in the repository name. These separators are more readable than spaces and are commonly used in repository names.
1. **Avoid Special Characters:** Avoid using special characters, spaces, or symbols in the repository name. Stick to alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
1. **Be Unique:** Check if the repository name you want is already in use by others. GitHub does not allow duplicate repository names within an account, so choose a unique name.
1. **Short and Sweet:** Keep the repository name reasonably short while maintaining descriptiveness. A name that's too long can be unwieldy.
1. **Use Keywords:** Consider including relevant keywords in the repository name to help users find it through search.
1. **Follow Naming Conventions:** If there are naming conventions or standards for your programming language or framework, consider following them. For example, Python packages often have lowercase names, and JavaScript libraries might use CamelCase.
1. **Avoid Trademarks:** Be cautious about using trademarks or copyrighted names in your repository name without permission.
1. **Use Proper Spelling:** Double-check your spelling to avoid typos or misspelled words in the repository name.
1. **Use Abbreviations Sparingly:** While abbreviations can save space, avoid excessive use of abbreviations that might confuse users. If you use abbreviations, make sure they are widely recognized.
1. **Consider Future Expansion:** Think about the potential for your project to grow or evolve. Choose a name that won't limit your project's scope.
1. **Include Version Numbers Sparingly:** If your repository represents a specific version of a project, you can include the version number in the name. However, this is not always necessary, and it's often better to use tags or releases for version information.
1. **Consistency Across Platforms:** If your project is hosted on multiple platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), try to keep the repository name consistent across them.
1. **Check URL Availability:** Consider how the repository name will appear in the URL (e.g., github.com/username/repo-name). Ensure that the URL is clear and easy to read.
1. **Update README:** Once you've chosen a repository name, update your README file to reflect the new name and provide a brief description.
